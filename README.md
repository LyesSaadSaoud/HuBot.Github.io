# HuBot: A Biomimicking Mobile Robot for Non-Disruptive Bird Behavior Study and Ecological Conservation
# Abstract
The Houbara bustard, a critically endangered avian species, poses significant challenges for researchers due to its elusive nature and sensitivity to human disturbance. Traditional research methods, often reliant on human observation, have yielded limited data and can inadvertently impact the birdâ€™s behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose for the first time HuBot, a biomimetic mobile robot designed to seamlessly integrate into the Houbara's natural habitat. Equipped with advanced real-time deep learning algorithms, including YOLOv9 for detection, MobileSAM for segmentation, and ViT for depth estimation, HuBot autonomously tracks individual birds, providing unprecedented insights into their movement patterns, social interactions, and habitat use. By accurately detecting and localizing the houbara, HuBot contributes to a deeper understanding of the Houbara's ecology and informs critical conservation decisions. The robot's biomimetic design, including life-like appearance and movement, minimizes disturbance, allowing for long-term, continuous monitoring without compromising data quality. Rigorous testing, including extensive laboratory experiments and captive trials with real Houbara birds, validated HuBot's performance and its potential to revolutionize the study of this enigmatic species. Through the deployment of HuBot, we aim to provide essential information for developing effective conservation strategies to safeguard the future of the Houbara bustard.
